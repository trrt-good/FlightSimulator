# FlightSimulator
The final game project for Comp Sci Java. 
All GUI is built with the swing api and rendering is done with my 3d rendering package. 
Terrain is generated using a simplex noise algorithm (which I didnt make). 

RUNNING THE CODE:
- have java installed
- download the repo
- open terminal and navigate to the directory that contains all the java files
- compile using `javac *.java`
- run by running `java FlightSimulator`
